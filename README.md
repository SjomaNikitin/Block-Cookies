# This open-source Chrome extension blocks cookies pop-ups/banners.

**How it works:**

1. This extension finds cookies pop-ups or banners using CSS selectors.

2. It adds the style `display: none !important` to every found pop-up.

3. Using a JavaScript file, it adds the style `overflow: auto !important` to some pages that have cookie pop-ups.

**How to use it:**

1. Open Chrome extension settings.

2. Turn on 'developer mode'.

3. Click 'load unpacked' and choose the folder named 'Block Cookies'.

**Limitations:**

1. It may not work on every website.

**How to help the author:**

If you find websites that still have cookies pop-ups while using the extension, please write the URL in the comments.

Thank you for your help.
